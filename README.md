##Description##
- This is a minesweeper game using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
- This is a single-player, tile-based computer game that tasks the player with uncovering tiles on a grid, aiming to locate a specific number of hidden "mines" while avoiding detonating any. 
- The game operates on a logic-based system where each click reveals information about adjacent tiles, allowing players to deduce the locations of the mines strategically by highlighting that specific tile to remember the mines location. 
- If a player clicks on a mine, it triggers game-over conditions.
